## What developers and plumbers have in common

## What they are
We say that a program leaks memory when it doesn't release memory that it's no longer using.

### And why are they so bad?
- GC pauses
- Swapping
- Crashing

## Are memory leaks possible in JS?
### No. But yes.
By some definitions, it's not a leak if memory can be reclaimed at least in theory.
